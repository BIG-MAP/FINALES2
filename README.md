# Installation of the package

The FINALES2 repository has a file structures, which allows it to be installed like a regular Python package using pip. For this to work, please follow the steps below:
*Step 1*
Clone the repository to your local machine.
*Step 2*
Navigate to the folder containing the repository. This folder should contain the src folder.
*Step 3*
Open a terminal in this path and enter pip install -e ./ to install the package as an editable package, which applies changes to your local clone of the repository. Alternatively, you can also use pip install ./ or pip install . to install it in non-editable mode, which is rather advisable for deployment, but not for development.

All the code for the FINALES2 package needs to go to the src/FINALES2 folder. Sub folders to this directory are possible.
