# Setup of the Docker environment

Follow these steps to set up Docker for deplying the latest development version of FINALES2.

1. You need an ssh key for the reposiory. You can follow this tutorial to set it up: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
    1. If you encounter an error when running the command `$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"` stating, that the command is not found, try to type the command manually instead of copying and pasting it.

1. Install Docker on your system (make sure to keep the WSL configuration unchanged)

1. Download the docker file and the docker-compose.yml file from the FINALES2/Dockerfiles directory in the repository and save them to a directory of your choice

1. Run the Docker container for the FINALES environment using the following commands:

    1. In a terminal, navigate to the directory, where the two files are saved

    1. Run `docker build -t finales:v0.1 .` (Do not overlook the trailing dot.)

    1. Run `docker volume create finales_data`

    1. Run `docker-compose up`
    The first two commands are only ran the first time and are used to create the image and the volume (for data persistence) respectively. The third command uses the image to start a container: it will block the terminal when it is executed but it can be stopped by pressing the <CTRL + C> keys. This will also stop the container, but then it can be restarted by running the command again. Once again, you don't need to re-create the image and the volume each time you restart the container (unless you specifically want to update the software inside the container or delete the old data), you just need to re-run this last command `docker-compose up`.

    1. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=qwerty0123 in your browser to check, if the container is running or use the Docker desktop app for this

1. If you use VS code, download and install the following extensions:
    1. Docker
    1. Dev Containers

1. Open the Docker Desktop application

1. Click on the Docker icon in the left sided navigation bar in VS Code and start the container called finalesv0.1

1. Click on the icon for the remote explorer in the left sided navigation bar in VS Code

1. Find the finales2docker in the list, hover over it and click the left most icon that pops up

1. This opens a new VS Code window within the Docker

1. Open the root folder "\"

1. Navigate to the directory called "data"

1. Create a folder called "ssh_keys"

1. Create a file called "github_key" and add your private key to this file

1. Navigate into the "ssh_keys" directory

1. Use the command `chmod 400 github_key` to change the permissions of the "github_key" file to read only

1. Navigate back to the "data" directory and clone the FINALES2 Github repository

# Get started with FINALES2

1. Install the FINALES2 package in editable mode
    1. Navigate to the FINALES2 repository in the Docker
    1. `pip install -e .`

# Start FINALES2

1. Initialize the database of FINALES by running `finales db init`

1. Populate the database with dummy values, if you need to retrieve data for your tests by running `finales devtest populate-db`

1. Start the FINALES server by running `finales server start --ip 0.0.0.0`


# Local installation of the package

The FINALES2 repository has a file structure, which allows it to be installed like a regular Python package using pip. For this to work, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

1. Navigate to the folder containing the repository. This folder should contain the src folder.

1. Open a terminal in this path and enter `pip install -e ./` to install the package as an editable package, which applies changes to your local clone of the repository. You can also use `pip install ./` or `pip install .` to install it in non-editable mode, which is rather advisable for deployment, but not for development.

All the code for the FINALES2 package needs to go to the src/FINALES2 folder. Sub folders to this directory are possible.
